# LOAN-RISK-ANALYSIS
In this project i used the publicly available dataset provided by lending club to analyze the trends and correlation of the variables in the dataset to the label that is called "Loan_statues", we will then make predictions to identify "Fully Paid" and "Charged Off" loans.
Two models were trained for this purpose, XGBClassifier and a NN to compare the results through a confusion matrix and AUC.
